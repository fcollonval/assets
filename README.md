# JupyterLab static assets

This repository is serving static assets for JupyterLab in particular it is serving the Jupyter news feed.

## The news feed

### How does it works?

This repository builds a [GitHub pages website](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) that will be published at https://jupyterlab.github.io/assets/.

The website is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). And the news feed fetched by JupyterLab is generated by the plugin [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/tree/v0.15.1); the Atom feed is accessible at https://jupyterlab.github.io/assets/feed.xml.

The feed plugin is parametrized to list only the most recent post (see the [configuration](./_config.yml)).

### How to publish a news?

To publish, you need to create a new PR that adds a new file in the folder [_posts](./_posts) named _YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST.md_. You must replace _YYYY-MM-DD_ with the date of your post and _NAME-OF-POST_ with the name of your post.

The file itself must follow this structure:

```md
---
layout: post
title: "Thanks for using JupyterLab"
date: 2022-11-02 14:00:00 -0000
categories: posts
excerpt: "Big thanks to you, beloved JupyterLab user."
---

# Welcome

Thanks a lot for your interest in JupyterLab.
```

The header must contain the following entries:
- _layout_: Set to `post`
- _title_: Your post title
- _date_: The date and time for the post
- _categories_: Space separated list that must contains `posts`
- _excerpt_: Short summary of the post

The notification displayed in JupyterLab will be the concatenation of the _title_ and the _excerpt_.

After the header, you can write the post using Markdown formatting.

You will find additional information in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#adding-a-new-post-to-your-site).

Once your PR is merged, the post will be the new one to be fetched by JupyterLab users.
